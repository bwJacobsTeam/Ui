            <h2> Who We Are</h2>
            <p> We are wildlife biologists who saw a massive disconnect in the way we could reach out for real-time global support for critical needs outside of our project's budget. We also knew conservation organizations all over the world were facing similar issues. <br><br>
            Additionally, supporters of conservation organizations want more transparency as to where their money is going, what the outcome of their support is, as well as better ways to stay connected.

            <h2> How Can We Help?</h2>
            <p>Key Conservation is helping conservationists gain critical funding and global support with the development of a mobile app. Organizations can create campaigns to request aid and then be connected to supporters for financial or local in-person assistance.

        <h2> How Did This Idea Come About?</h2>
        <p><!-- turtle story -->The idea first came to us when we were working on a sea turtle project together in the Caribbean. The project had a hotline where locals and tourists could call in problems or sightings they had of sea turtles. One day we received a call about a nest that was being washed out to sea. We ran out to our patrol vehicle to head down to the nest only to realize we didn't have enough fuel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = noturtle>
        <p>The problem was that our project did not have any current funding to utilize; We would have to wait until the following week for. We could not just let the nest wash out to sea, so we used the small stipend we had for our own food to fill the tank. <br><br>
        During the drive to the nest, all we could think about was how there had to be a better way to reach out to the world to get real-time support. We all knew at least 5 people who would have given us $20 to fill our gas tank, just so they could tell their friends they helped save baby sea turtles in the Caribbean that day.</p>
